# Prosper or Perish Constructor

## Repository Workflow

- Use `uv run ppc --help` as the canonical command index before running project workflows.
- Prefer `uv run ppc test`, `uv run ppc inspect`, `uv run ppc analyze`, and `uv run ppc blueprint ...` over raw `eu5-orchestrator` commands unless debugging the wrapper itself.
- Use parser/evaluator commands for game-data and blueprint questions instead of text-searching generated mod files.
- Treat `uv run ppc sync --yes` as a live deploy action. Do not run it unless the user explicitly asks to mirror into the live Paradox mod folder.
- Machine-local paths and deploy targets belong in ignored `constructor.local.toml`.

## Generated Outputs

- Generated parquet, graph, report, and blueprint outputs are reproducible artifacts.
- Commit reusable config, accepted blueprints, scripts, docs, tests, and repo skills.
- Avoid reverting existing dirty mod or generated files unless the user explicitly requests it.
